# DD4hep simulation plugins, front-end, and related utilities

This repository contains (non-geometry) DD4hep-based simulation plugins and the `npsim` front-end for running EIC simulations.

This repository also contains several other tools to interact with DD4hep-based geometries:
- `dd_web_display`
- `npdet_fields`
- `npdet_info`
- `npdet_to_gdml`
- `npdet_to_step`
- `npdet_to_teve`

This repository originates in the [NPDet project](https://eicweb.phy.anl.gov/EIC/NPDet/).
